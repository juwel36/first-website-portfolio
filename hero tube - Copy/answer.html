<h1 class="text-2xl font-semibold pt-14">1: Discuss the scope of var, let, and const .</h1>
<p class="pt-2"> <span class="text-green-700 font-serif font-semibold">Ans:</span> var, let, and const are three different ways to declare variables in JavaScript, and they have different scopes and behaviors. Let's explore the scope of each: <br>
 1.var= The var keyword was historically used to declare variables in JavaScript before let and const were introduced.The scope of a var variable is functional scope.It can be updated and re-declared into the scope.It can be accessed without initialization as its default value is “undefined”.
<br>
2.let=The let keyword was introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) to address some of the issues with var regarding scoping. Variables declared with let are block-scoped, The scope of a let variable is block scope.It can be updated but cannot be re-declared into the scope. <br>

3.const = The const keyword is also introduced in ES6 and is used to declare variables that are meant to be constants. Like let, const variables are also block-scoped. It cannot be updated or re-declared into the scope

<h1 class="text-2xl font-semibold pt-6 pb-3">2: Tell us the use cases of null and undefined </h1>
<p><span class="text-green-700 font-serif font-semibold">Ans:</span>    In programming, particularly in languages like JavaScript, "null" and "undefined" are both special values that represent the absence or lack of a meaningful value. They are often used in different contexts for specific purposes. Here are the common use cases for "null" and "undefined":

  **1. null:**
  Explicit Absence of Value,Initialization,Data Cleaning,Default Value,Error Handling:
  
  **2. undefined:**
  -Variable Declaration,Function without a Return Value,Missing Object Properties,Array Elements,Implicit Return.
  
  In summary, "null" is often used to represent a deliberate absence of a value or to signify missing or unknown data, while "undefined" typically indicates the lack of assignment or the absence of an expected value in various programming contexts. Understanding when to use each of these values is essential for writing clean, error-free code.</p>

<h1 class="text-2xl font-semibold pt-6 pb-3">3: What do you mean by REST API ?</h1>
<p class="pb-10 "><span class="text-green-700 font-serif font-semibold">Ans:</span> A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is an architectural style for designing web services. It employs standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to enable clients and servers to communicate. Key principles include client-server separation, statelessness, cacheability, uniform interface, layered structure, and optional code-on-demand. Each resource is identified by a URL, and HTTP methods perform CRUD operations. REST APIs ensure consistent, scalable, and efficient data exchange between systems, allowing them to interact seamlessly over networks.</p>
